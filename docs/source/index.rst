Welcome to bepr's documentation!
===================================

**Bepr** is a Python library for researchers 
that are interested in studying the bacteriophage effect 
on parasitism resistance based on a mathematical approach.
It contains the a mathematical model based on Aphid, APSE 
and parasitoid interaction. The detailed description of the 
biological system and the model is available <https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03382/>.
